The interactive STEM education platform project aims to make science and mathematics learning more accessible and engaging in today's technology-driven world. It serves as a dynamic platform for students seeking to strengthen their understanding of complex theories through interactive, game-like simulations. The main goal is to enhance STEM education by fostering problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and practical application of scientific and mathematical concepts through technology-driven visual learning techniques. 

The project team engaged educators, students, and academic researchers through interviews, surveys, and focus groups to identify user needs before the launch. Key focuses included increasing student engagement, improving conceptual clarity, and delivering interdisciplinary learning experiences. Research revealed a strong demand for innovative teaching strategies that address difficulties in grasping abstract theories, with studies highlighting the effectiveness of interactive simulations in boosting both theoretical and practical comprehension

Many students struggle with understanding STEM subjects due to the abstract nature of concepts and the lack of practical application opportunities. Meanwhile, educators face challenges in designing engaging exercises and dealing with resource limitations. The platform addresses these issues by offering simulations that provide real-time visualizations, step-by-step theoretical explanations, and interactive problem-solving exercises. It aims to bridge the gap between disciplines, offering a holistic learning environment that traditional educational simulations often lack

Existing tools such as PhET Interactive Simulations , GeoGebra , Algodoo, and ChemCollective have contributed significantly to STEM education by visualizing individual scientific concepts. However, they primarily focus on singular disciplines and often lack integrated interdisciplinary features, interactive computational insights, and personalized learning pathways. This highlights the need for a comprehensive platform that unifies science and mathematics education while fostering deeper, hands-on engagement. 

The proposed platform introduces a dynamic, hands-on approach to STEM education, enabling students to grasp complex theories through effective visualizations and structured, interactive learning modules. By integrating multiple disciplines and offering real-time simulations, the project aims to revolutionize STEM education, significantly improving student engagement, conceptual clarity, and practical understanding.
